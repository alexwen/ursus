# Ursus

### Overview

Ursus is a [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/) inspired framework for developing lightweight
production-ready web services on the JVM and [Grizzly](https://grizzly.java.net/). Ursus combines Grizzly's
NIO/Event Driven framework with popular libraries such as [Jersey 2.5.1](https://jersey.java.net/) and
[Project Tyrus - JSR 356: Java API for WebSocket - Reference Implementation](https://tyrus.java.net/) with
the simple conventions made popular by Dropwizard, allowing you to focus on developing your services rather
than managing their accompanying dependencies, reducing time-to-market and maintenance.
